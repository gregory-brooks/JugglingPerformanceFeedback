# JugglingPerformanceFeedback
Introduction      One of the best ways to improve at a hobby is to measure your current performance and get feedback. Coaches for sports have increasingly advanced methods for analyzing performance, and technical tools can provide insight beyond the human eye, see this article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1747954118808081.   This project's goal is to provide juggling performance feedback so that people can improve in their skill.   The first implementation of this feedback performance will be simple, and perhaps not deployable, but I'm excited to see where this will go. Hopefully it will become a web-app that the juggling community on Instagram can utilize, so they can share their results.
